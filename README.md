# VulnHaven
Our sweet vulnerable baby.

Welcome to **VulnHaven**, an experimental and intentionally vulnerable project crafted to explore, test, and showcase vulnerability detection tools like the **VulnCheck GitHub Action** and **CLI**. VulnHaven is a fictional cyber fortress intentionally riddled with weaknesses, designed for researchers, developers, and hackers??? It is also entirely developed by AI. Sorry.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This repository is for **educational and testing purposes only**. The code within is deliberately insecure and must never be deployed in production environments. Use it exclusively in isolated testing setups. The creators bear no responsibility for any misuse or unintended consequences arising from the use of this project.

## üåå The Story of VulnHaven

VulnHaven was once a bustling digital metropolis, home to the brightest minds in cyber innovation. However, a catastrophic event‚Äîknown as "The Breach"‚Äîexposed every weakness within its walls. Once thought impregnable, its infrastructure crumbled under the weight of outdated libraries, unsecured secrets, and poorly constructed defenses. Now, VulnHaven stands as a cautionary tale and a playground for those who dare to explore its vulnerabilities. 

Legend has it that anyone who masters the vulnerabilities of VulnHaven will gain the skills to protect even the most impenetrable systems. Will you rise to the challenge?

## üìã Features

The project highlights several classes of vulnerabilities:

1. **SQL Injection**
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
3. **Command Injection**
4. **Insecure Dependencies**
5. **Hardcoded Secrets**
6. **Outdated Libraries**

These vulnerabilities mimic real-world scenarios, offering a realistic environment for testing and learning.

## üîç Testing with VulnCheck
